# Wot de FOSS?

Trying to grok how MongoDB, Node and Express work together. 

Will be working on this some more to flesh this out if I get the time to do so.

### Setup?
--- 

`npm i`

##### NOTE :
--- 

For this project, make sure MongoDB runs at version 2.2.34.

`npm i mongodb@^2.2.34` should do it.
